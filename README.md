Scripts for using a Raspberry Pi as the hub for home automation

I bought an early Raspberry Pi back in 2015.  I wanted to do some home automation and didn't like the idea of depending on 
hardware and software systems over which I had limited control.  I started with turning on and off some lights on a schedule. 
At the time, the easiest way to do this was a bit of python script.  That script is going in this repository for reference.
